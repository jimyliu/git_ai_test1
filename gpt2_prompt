🖼 LAYERED IMAGE SYSTEM (CRITICAL UPGRADE)
The canvas must support multiple visual layers, rendered in the following strict order:

Layer order must never break.

🌄 BACKGROUND IMAGE LAYER (NEW – MANDATORY)
User can load a separate background image
Example use case:
Christmas theme
Holiday pattern
Seasonal graphic
Background image fills the entire canvas
Aspect ratio preserved
Can be:
auto-fit (contain / cover logic allowed)

Background image is NOT draggable by default
🌫 Background Opacity Control
Slider to control background image transparency
Range:
20% → 100% (higher percentage means more transparency

Changes apply only to background image

Rendered above background image
Original aspect ratio preserved

Drag behavior must match Title / Subtitle dragging

Thickness must be uniform on all sides

✍️ TEXT OVERLAY SYSTEM (CRITICAL)

Both title, subtitle has background color to select from color picker and the background color can adjust transparency as well with slider
